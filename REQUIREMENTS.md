# Web Scraper Requirements

## Project Overview
A Python application that scrapes content from websites and downloads text, images, and videos to a local directory structure.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Content Scraping**
   - Extract text content from web pages
   - Download images (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG)
   - Download videos (MP4, WebM, AVI, MOV)
   - Handle different file formats and sizes

2. **URL Processing**
   - Accept single URLs or lists of URLs
   - Support depth-limited crawling (follow links to specified depth)
   - Respect robots.txt files
   - Handle redirects and relative URLs

3. **File Management**
   - Organize content in structured local directories
   - Avoid duplicate downloads
   - Generate meaningful filenames
   - Preserve original file extensions

4. **Configuration**
   - Configurable download directories
   - User-agent customization
   - Request rate limiting/delays
   - File type filters (include/exclude specific types)
   - Maximum file size limits

### Technical Requirements
1. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful handling of network failures
   - Skip broken/inaccessible content
   - Comprehensive logging
   - Resume capability for interrupted downloads

2. **Performance**
   - Concurrent downloads (configurable thread pool)
   - Progress tracking and reporting
   - Memory-efficient streaming for large files

3. **Compliance**
   - Respect robots.txt
   - Implement polite crawling delays
   - Handle rate limiting responses (429 status codes)

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- CLI interface with clear progress indicators
- Extensible architecture for adding new content types
- Configuration file support (YAML/JSON)

## Out of Scope (Initial Version)
- JavaScript-rendered content (SPA scraping)
- Authentication/login handling
- Database storage
- Web UI interface
- Content parsing/analysis beyond basic extraction

## Success Criteria
- Successfully download text, images, and videos from target websites
- Maintain organized directory structure
- Handle errors gracefully without crashing
- Provide clear progress feedback to users
- Respect website policies and implement ethical scraping practices
